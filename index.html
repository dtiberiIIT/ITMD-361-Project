      <p>
        Hi, I'm Dan! I'm currently studying ITM-Software Development with a minor in Computer Science
        at the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago, Il. I am also a developer at a startup called Tensor Labs.
        I have been passionate about software development from the age of 15 and I am always eager to take on a new programming challenge.
        If you'd like to hear more about my programming experience, visit the <a href="/programming/index.html">programming</a> page.

        Beyond my professional career, I am passionate about history, green-energy,
        vintage films, spending time with loved ones, and helping others.
